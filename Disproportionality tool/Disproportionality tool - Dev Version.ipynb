    "## Drift tool: Dev version\n",
    "This notebook is based on the disproportionality excel tool made by Jean Mallo at Richmond and Wandsworth. It provides visualisations demonstrating how the ethnicity distribution in a certain population differs from that in another given population. To make these comparisons the notebook uses data stored publicly on the DfE website, and user inputted local ethnicity distribution data, calculates differences in proportion of ethnic representation and whether the difference is statistically significant, and then demonstrates this in visualisations using a number of different measures.\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: The order of the code in this notebook does not conform to normal practice in order to make it more usable. For instance, it is uncommon to input variables before importing necessary packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "The minutiae of how each cell works are given above the cells int he markdown and in the comments in the cells themselves, but the general overview of the notebook is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) The notebook opens the zipped folder of excel files of different DfE census data from the gov.uk website and reads in the excel file containing data about ethnicity. \n",
    "\n",
    "2) The user must complete the setup section. The user must specify an LA for comparison, a time period, andinput data for ethnic populations in the 'ethnic_input' dictionary. The download version of the notebook uses the 202122 time period, East Sussex, and fake data for demonstration purposes, but it is easy to paste your own data over it in the setup section below this cell. The LA name, and time periods must be given as they are in the DfE csv. If you want to check you can print the file by uncommenting the print(LAnames) to the bottom of the first code cell and checking the names of the LAs that are printed below the cell and copy pasting them into the setup section. The same is possible for the time periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) After the notebook has read in the data, users should input a time period and LA for comparisons for the relevant variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) The notebook then extracts, from the DfE .csv the data for the correct year and LA based on the results of the dropdowns. It puts them into a new dataframe for comparisons ComparisonDF and calculates sums of total main ethnic groups from sub-group numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) The notebook then calculares percentage, rate per 10,000 and RRI (Relative Rate Index) for the user's data and adds these as columns to the ComparisonDF.\n",
    "\n",
    "6) Following this, based on the Disproportionality calculater excel tool, the notebook perfors calculations necessary for a Chi Squared test of independence to determine if population differences are statistically significant. This test is then done in a later cell using the method used in the Excel tool, and Python's scipy chisquared function. New columns are then added to ComparisonDF to indicate whether values are statistically significant in their differences or not, which is used later to colour plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "7) Finally, for each of RRI, rate per 10,000, and percentages, graphs are plotted to show disproportionality. These are made in seaborn, and custom palettes are made for each graph to colour the bars to correctly indicate whether differences in populations are different by a statistically significant amount from the test population.\n",

    "This cell imports necessary packages and gets the data needed for comparisons from the DfE website. It uses the requests package to get the zip file from the DfE URL, and checks it works with the ok method, it then reads the bytes data it recieves using io and, as it's a zip file, uses the zipfile package to unzip it so that Pandas can read it as a .csv. This seems difficult but the code is relatively boilerplate for any time you want to get a zipped .csv from a url and read it into a Pandas dataframe, so can easilt be copy/pasted with the variables changed.\n",

Further, in earlier versions of Python, dictionaries are not ordered, for this setup to work, ensure that you are using Python version 3.6+. If you are not using Pythong 3.6+, input the numerical values in the order given below into a list variable called InputList at the bottom of the next cell.

It then creates lists of the main ethnic groups comprising of sub groups for calculations later. Next it runs through the list of ethnic sub groups and outputs them to a datafram LAdf. Finally, using these numbers, ethnic main group totals are calculated,and these are also added to LAdf.

    "This final set of calculations performs the ones that are seen on the plots and in the charts at the end of the notebook. It starts by adding the lookup codes for different racial sub and major groups, then performs lookups for whether the input variables are statistically different and either higher or lower than the census, or not statistically different, for RRI, RP10k and Percentage calculations. As they are performing roughly the same calculations, the following three cells are essentially the same, They could have been replaced by functions, but given they only needed to be reteated three times, it was not much quicker to write functions, and the fucntions might have been more ifddly to write. Given the similarity, only one cell is heavily commented. Note that in relevant sig higher, lower, and no diff columns, only one column should have a non-zero value.\n",
