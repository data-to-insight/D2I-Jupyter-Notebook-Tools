    "<span style=\"font-size:10pt\">Scrapes all local authorities 'Childrens Services Ofsted Inspection' reports* creating (an enhanced version) the 'Ofsted ILACS Outcomes summary' report**. Output is optionally in either csv or direct to xls format. As well as creating the summary report, the process scrapes/downloads and organises into named folders*** the Children's Services <b>full</b> inspection reports(i.e. not interim, focused nor monitoring visits) in their original pdf. Each LA name is 'cleaned' to aid a standard/onward process use of LA naming - e.g. 'Nottingham City Council' becomes 'Nottingham' and 'Barnsley Metropolitan Borough Council' becomes 'Barnsley'. There are some work-in-progress elements included within the export summary towards inspection sentiment score grading/onward analysis; the thresholds and low-level testing on these are part of some potential future work. </span><br>\n",

The tool has avoided the use of Selenium or similar as this is more likely to be impacted by visual design changes on the page(s). Instead it relies on the underlying php search process, and associated php generated links.</span>"
