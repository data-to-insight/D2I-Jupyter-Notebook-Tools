    "## Drift tool: Dev version\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of versions of the drift tool with varying levels of user input needed in order to get drift visualisation. They range from a mostly empty sheet of code with some prompts that allows users to learn Python by writing their own, through to the usability version of the tool, which, other than using the run button at the top of the page, and having some knowledge about the CSV files with drift data in, requires next to no python knowledge at all to get the drift visualisations. The key benefit of this tool is ease of use, but this tool, and others, have lots of scope for users to make changes to the code if they feel confident in order to change the visualisations and outputs to the ones that they want or need.\n",
    "\n",
    "The drift visualisations demonstrate how long it takes children to go between different stages of Children's Services provision. For instance, how long children wait between a referral and a CIN or CP plan, how long children wait between CP plans and a CLA status, and also larger periods such as how long children wait between initial referral and a CLA status. These statistics are presented in two ways, the first is histograms demonstrating spread of wait times between different stages of Children's Services provision. This first visualisation is a useful way of demonstrating what proportions of children are waiting what lengths of times for different levels of provision. The second, and most important visualisation, presents bar and box plots demonstrating the wait times between different provisions starting in different years. This second set of visualisations allows users to see how long children waited tro recieve different types of provision in any year, over a range of years. This can be used to help determine if wait times are improving or not, and see trends in wait times over time."

    "## User Guide\n",
    "The dev version of the drift tool is the easiest to run multiple times and tinker with for people with Python experience. Unlike the usability version, it doesn't feature widgets to upload files and change visualisations, but this simplifies both code and resterting/re-running the kernel. This means that it's easier to make changes and run the whole code in one go.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get the drift visualisations out of this notebook, simply update the filepath directory a few cells below this one with the filepath leading to the location where your referrals, CP plan, and CLA status CSVs are stored. Ensure the filepath is surrounded by quotes ('') and thatthese quotes are preceeded by an r. Each CSV should have two columns, one of Person_ID, and the other with the corresponding date of either referral, CP plan startd date, or CLA status start date. You then need to write the name of the each CSV to the corresponding variables in the cell a few below this one, remembering to finish the file names with .csv, and to surround them with quotes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once, this is done, you should be able to select the restart and re-run the whole notebook button, and have some visualisations to look at. Following this, you can start changing some code to make it do different things. An interesting things to change are the years over which calculations are made for the plots (cells towards the end of the notebook). It totally changes the model, but another interesting things to change in the notebook is to go from calculating how long people waited to reach the next level of childrens services provision based on the year they recieved it, to how long children waited based on when they reached the previous stage. One problem with this method though, and why it's not used in this tool, is that it skews the outputs in recent years as children who have very long wait times, and those who are still waiting, will not show up, making early years look worse, and recent years look better."

    "# Limitations of the model:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) The data for the model builds over time, for the earliest years in the data set, there is not much data, as such, the further back you look in the visualisationsthe less appropriate those years are as indications of drift. As such, in the plots which display wait time by end year, only the most recent five years are in colour, but the earlier years are still included to demonstrate where the data for the model is drawn from.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) The model calculates the time between referral and CP plan and referral and CLA  plan by assuming that the last referral before any CP plan or CLA status is the one that lead to that plan or status, this means that for a small number of children who have a referral then CP plan and then CLA status without another referral, the one referral will count as the most recent referral for both the CP plan and the CLA status. This is not necessarily wrong for all cases, as the assumption can be made in some cases that if a child had a referral and was moved from CP plan to CLA status, they ought to have had a CLA status initially, instead of a CP plan. As the number of times this happens is small, relative to the rest of the data, and it happens every year, it it relatively balanced out across the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) A small number of data points are dropped in an effort to remove data points that the model would calculate incorrectly leading to large false outliers - some children have a referral very shortly after a CP plan or CLA status is started which is due to some quirks in the way that childrens services case management systems work, if those children then move from CLA status to CP plan  years later, the calculations would count that as having waited years from that referral to the CP plan. To avoid this, children who have a referral within two weeks of a CP plan or CLA status are dropped from the model to avoid these large "

    "Now we have read the data tables and put them into Pandas data frames, we need to find every child who has had a referral that has lead to a CP plan, a referral that has lead to a CLA status, and a CP plan that has lead to CLA status. The easiest way to do this is to merge the relevant tables together, using Person ID to link them. Doing this means is that we will end up with a table that, for each Person ID, links every row of table 1 to every row of table 2.  This means that we end up with a row linking every single referral and CP/CLA status, for instance. This is a problem because children may have more than one referral before, and either after a CP plan or CLA status, and we end up with a data frame that links every one of these referrals to each of these CP pland and CLA statuses. For example, say a child has had referrals in 2012, 2013, and 2014 and had a CP plan starting in 2014, the way the merge works is it will make rows joining the 2012, 2012, and 2014 referrals to the 2014 CP plan. This gives us wait times that do not reflect reality as we can assume that the 2012 and 2013 referrals did not need to result in a CP plan as the 2014 one did.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result of this, we need to find a way to only show the time between referrals and CP plans or CLA statuses that where the referral was actually deemed sufficient to lead to a CP plan or CLA status (or CP plan lead to CLA status). To do this, we have to assume that the most recent referral before al CP plan or CLA status is the one that leads to that plan or status, which as it is normally true is a fair assumption to make.\n",
    "\n",
    "There area number of ways we might want to go about this. One is to hope that our data is already ordered by date for every Person ID and drop all but the most recent row, hoping this gives us the most recent referral that lead to a CP plan. This doesn't work, however: the data may not be ordered right, it's best not to assume that it is, and this would also mean we would be taking some rows where the CP plan was before the referral if a child has had a referral after their most recent CP plan. Another option is to sort by Person ID and then date, so that for every child the dates of their referrals are in order. We then drop any rows where referrals were after, say, CP plans, and hope that the last row is the one with the most recent referral that lead to a CP plan, and drop every row for every child, except that one. This is better, but it still requires that this correctly orders the end dates how we expect, which it may, but we don't want to risk it. The best method is to calculate the wait times between referral and CP plan, and then sort according to Child ID and then wait time, taking just the shortest, non-negative, wait time. In most, typical cases, this should give us the most recent referral that lead to a CP plan. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are still problems, however. This actually gives us the shortest time period between referral and CP plan. For some children, for instance with two CP plans, we will only have information about one of those wait times. So, we can do even better: rather than dropping all but the rows with the shortest wait times with the same Person ID, we can drop all but the shortest wait times with the same Person ID for each CP plan. We can do this by ordering according to Person ID and wait time (delta), and then dropping all but the first row which share a Person ID and CP plan start date. This should give us the shortest positive time between every referral and CP plan for every child. Sadly, there are still problems with this method! In some rare instances, a CP plan or CLA status will start slightly before a referral is logged, this means that, in these instances, the referral before the one related to the CP plan or CLA status will be the one with a row with wait time data. We could fix this, potentially, by dropping rows with a referral shortly after a CP plan or CLA status as outliers, but the implimentation of this may have unintended impact outside of these rows, and the current method allows these rare instances to be balanced out by the averages.\n",
    "\n",
    "This final thing can be fixed by finding every referral that's shortly after a CP or CLA status, in the code we've chosen 2 weeks. We can then make a list of IDs for which this is the case, and then drop all the rows from the main data frame where the IDs match. This loses some data points, but avoids some very long wait times that occur as a result of having the referral after the CLA status or CP plan.\n",
    "\n",
    "A final issue, and one that's more difficult to solve, is one where children may have a referral that leads them to a CLA status, and be downgraded to a CP plan later, the calculations below will count that as a wait between referral and CP plan taking a very long time!"
