This set of workshops introduces:
Variables and basic data types (str, int, float), and how we need to consider that data types are acted on by the same operation differently
Different ways of storing data/objects: lists, dictionaries, dataframes, and key methods associated with each
Writing functions simply, with appropriate names, with docstrings, raising forseen errors
Extending that to lambda functions and list comprehensions
Basic pytest functionality
Using documentation to work out how to do things
