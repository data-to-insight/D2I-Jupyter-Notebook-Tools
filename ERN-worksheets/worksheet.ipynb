Every time we use the package, we'd have to tell Python we want to, bu calling 'pandas' but this is a bit long to do over and over, so the accepted way is to import pandas as pd, and we can use pd as short for pandas.

In this case, we will make a dictionary, with each key being a column, and all the values in lists being the values in that column per row."
